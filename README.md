### Plan of action

- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tvdermeer/NLP_hackathon/blob/main/NLP_hackathon_fine_tuning.ipynb) Fine-tune our own model
- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tvdermeer/NLP_hackathon/blob/main/NLP_hackathon_metrics.ipynb Run metrics for testing our model
